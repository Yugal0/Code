each result is saved as figures in both png and svg formats
svg format files can be opened in a browser (it opens in my edge)
each result file name contain name of the model which is being tested and the values of the parameters for the synthetic data on which the model(s) is/are fitted. 
the name of the result doesnt contain any other information
an example name for the result file is shown in next line

two R1 100 R2 10 delta 0.5 Q 1e-4 alpha 1.png	(or .svg)

this means the result for two step model when the synthetic data is generated by R1 as 100 ohms, R2 as 10 ohms, delta as 0.5, Q as 1e-4 farads and alpha is 1
